# usb_cam [![ROS2 CI](https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam/actions/workflows/build_test.yml)

## A ROS2 Driver for V4L USB Cameras
This package is based off of V4L devices specifically instead of just UVC.

For ros1 documentation, see [the ROS wiki](http://ros.org/wiki/usb_cam).

## Supported ROS2 Distros and Platforms

All Officially supported Linux Distros and corresponding ROS2 releases are supported. Please create an issue if you experience any problems on these platforms.

Windows: TBD/Untested/Unproven
MacOS: TBD/Untested/Unproven

For either MacOS or Windows - if you would like to try and get it working please create an issue to document your effort. If it works we can add it to the instructions here!

## Quickstart

Assuming you have a supported ROS2 distro installed, run the following command to install the binary release:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros2-distro>-usb-cam
```

As of today this package should be available for binary installation on all active ROS2 distros.

If for some reason you cannot install the binaries, follow the directions below to compile from source.

## Building from Source

Clone/Download the source code into your workspace:

```
cd /path/to/colcon_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam.git
```

Or click on the green "Download zip" button on the repo's github webpage.

Once downloaded and ensuring you have sourced your ROS2 underlay, go ahead and install the dependencies:

```
cd /path/to/colcon_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y
```

From there you should have all the necessary dependencies installed to compile the `usb_cam` package:

```
cd /path/to/colcon_ws
colcon build
source /path/to/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash
```

Be sure to source the newly built packages after a successful build.

Once sourced, you should be able to run the package in one of three ways, shown in the next section.

## Running

The `usb_cam_node` can be ran with default settings, by setting specific parameters either via the command line or by loading in a parameters file.

We provide a "default" params file in the `usb_cam/config/params.yaml` directory to get you started. Feel free to modify this file as you wish.

Also provided is a launch file that should launch the `usb_cam_node_exe` executable along with an additional node that displays an image topic.

The commands to run each of these different ways of starting the node are shown below:

**NOTE: you only need to run ONE of the commands below to run the node**
```
# run the executable with default settings (without params file)
ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe

# run the executable while passing in parameters via a yaml file
ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --ros-args --params-file /path/to/colcon_ws/src/usb_cam/config/params.yaml

# launch the usb_cam executable that loads parameters from the same `usb_cam/config/params.yaml` file as above
# along with an additional image viewer node
ros2 launch usb_cam demo_launch.py
```
## Launching Multiple usb_cam's

To launch multiple nodes at once, simply remap the namespace of each one:

```
ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --remap __ns:=/usb_cam_0 --params-file /path/to/usb_cam/config/params_0.yaml
ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe --remap __ns:=/usb_cam_1 --params-file /path/to/usb_cam/config/params_1.yaml
```


## Compression

Big thanks to [the `ros2_v4l2_camera` package](https://gitlab.com/boldhearts/ros2_v4l2_camera#usage-1) and their documentation on this topic.

The `usb_cam` should support compression by default since it uses `image_transport` to publish its images as long as the `image_transport_plugins` package is installed on your system. With the plugins installed the `usb_cam` package should publish a `compressed` topic automatically.

Unfortunately `rviz2` and `show_image.py` do not support visualizing the compressed images just yet so you will need to republish the compressed image downstream to uncompress it:

```
ros2 run image_transport republish compressed raw --ros-args --remap in/compressed:=image_raw/compressed --remap out:=image_raw/uncompressed
```
